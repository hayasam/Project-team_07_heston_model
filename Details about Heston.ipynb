    "The Black Scholes Model (BSM) assumes that volatility is constant when calculating option prices. However it is a known fact that the BSM assumptions are violated in real markets. It was noted that the implied volatility i.e. the volatility implied from traded options, was not constant but showed dependence on the strike price. This strike dependency is referred to as the implied volatility smile. The stochastic nature of volatility leads to complicated approaches as there were no analytical solutions present. It was Hull and White who have first introduced a model explaining implied volatility. Heston Model was a more developed version which offered an analytic formula in a semi-closed form for the price of a vanilla option.\n",
